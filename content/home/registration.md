## Step 1: Participant Registration Form {#step1}

Participants are required to register before taking part of CTBF. We made it simple for participants to register by completing ONE single form online.

The Spring 2021 Participant Registration Form will be available here soon!

When completing the Participant Data Form, you will be asked about your medical history. If after answering the questions, it is indicated that a medical **clearance is recommended**, you will need approval from a health care professional before participating in the CTBF Program. Please, [contact us](#contact) if you have any questions.
