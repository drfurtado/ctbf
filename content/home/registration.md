## Participant Data Form

Participants are required to register before taking part of CTBF. We made it simple for participants to register by completing ONE single form online.

{{< cta cta_text="Click here to register" cta_link="http://bit.ly/ctbf-register" cta_new_tab="true" >}}

When completing the Participant Data Form, you will be asked to complete and sign both the **CSUN Waiver of Liability and Hold Harmless Agreement** and the **Visual/Audio Image Release Form (optional)**.

When completing the Participant Data Form, you will be asked about your medical history. If after answering the questions, it is indicated that a medical **clearance is recommended**, you will need approval from a health care professional before participating in the CTBF Program. Please, [contact us](#contact) if you have any questions.
