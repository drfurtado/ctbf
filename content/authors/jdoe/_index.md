My name is John Doe and I am a junior in the Kin major's Exercise Science option. My goal is to become a Physical Therapist. Through my course work and experience in the field, I hope to gain insight as to if this is really what I want to pursue, but so far things are looking up as I continue down the pathway to PT school. 

I hope to work with children, I have been around children my whole life and it is a population that I feel would be extremely rewarding to work with. While I think that I know I want to work within the realm of Pediatrics, who knows what my interests will be once I am exposed to other populations and specialties! I have an interest in Occupational Therapy as well but I am slightly more drawn to Physical Therapy.
